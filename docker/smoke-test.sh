# Checks: nodes start and join; browser addresses are published on the fixed
# ports; a restart keeps node identities and starts the nodes again; the
# previous image's /data/node-<port> layout is taken over with identities
# kept; lowering NODE_COUNT retires a node; changing PORT_START moves the
# nodes with identities kept; docker stop is clean and timely;
# the node manager's disk-pressure eviction removes nodes (never the last)
# when the disk is nearly full; and a data folder mounted noexec is refused.
